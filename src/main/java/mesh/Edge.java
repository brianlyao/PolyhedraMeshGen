/**
 * A class encapsulating a single edge between vertices of a mesh. The edge,
 * much like faces, is specified by the indexes of the vertex positions in
 * the Mesh. It requires exactly two vertices to define an edge by its
 * endpoint vertices.
 * 
 * The edge behaves like an unordered pair of integers. The equals() and
 * hashCode() methods have been overridden to ensure this behavior.
 * 
 * The edge stores a pointer to the mesh it belongs to, but this is null until
 * this edge is computed with some context. In particular, setMesh() needs to
 * be called for some methods to work properly. This is done implicitly for the
 * edges returned when calling getEdges() on a face.
